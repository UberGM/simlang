#simlang
simlang is a ruby library that keeps things simple. You can make very simple programs using simlang, wether it be for fun
or just out of boredom!
simlang is still in it's early alpha stages and is expanding as you read this! In it's current form, simlang has very few
operations to do, but there will still be much more to come.
